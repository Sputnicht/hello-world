# hello-world
a short description

I like to describe myself as a philosopher, former Green Beret medic, a private military/security contractor, permanent college student, extreme outdoor activity and sports enthusiast, budding entrepreneur, computer fiend, and a small, insignificant flicker of light in the dark & seemingly infinite timeline of our universe.
